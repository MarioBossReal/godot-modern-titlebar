A modern titlebar redesign for Godot 4.6 written in C++ using GDExtension for Windows 11 and 10.

This is only a prototype, and currently only supports Windows 11 and 10.
It is being developed mainly for Windows 11, however it has been tested on Windows 10 and works well except
that it removes the native 1px window border and subwindow titlebars aren't colour matched to the editor's colour.
